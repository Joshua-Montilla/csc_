# If I had infinite programming skills I'd work a job in cybersecurity. My main goal is towards cybersecurity but with infinite skills theres infinite possibilities. I'd be a great asset to my friend who very well enjoys creating games. With my love for games I would definitely make my own game more likely to be story based with unique systems that in due time can be thought of. If I were to ever have any errors what so ever it'd be easily figured out and fixed with my skill set in this case and trust me I've had many issues before that I've wanted to fix but couldn't fix.
# Having infinite programming skills truely makes anything possible.. Such power can be dangerous for the world if used by the wrong hands if you really come to think about it. But in good hands it can really help the world out and it really does need the help with the many issues it suffers from with the bugs, errors, and hackers that try to ruin anything and cannot be fixed but with infinite skills I can fix it. 
# Thinking about having such an ability sounds so exciting honestly because it easily helps me complete all my goals in life. I want to be able to do anything with computers such as fixing them, making them, understanding the systems, understanding proper coding, making games that may even become extremely popular, so many ideas with endless possibilities.. Would be nice if I had infinite programming skills.
